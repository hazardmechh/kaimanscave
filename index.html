      <p>I have terrible memory due to health conditions, so Im sorry if I ever forget something, I mostly do remember
        names & definitely remember important information but there still might be things I cant remember fully, hope
        its understandable.</p>

        out. Words burst in your essence and you carry their dust in the pores of your ethereal individuality."
