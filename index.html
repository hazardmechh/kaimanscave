      <p>I like a bunch of book series but I mostly like horror, sci-fi, fantasy kinda things, 
       I also enjoy non-fictional works like philosophy, political works and the like. I love work that has specevo in it, I try to follow bio-chem works but it is not my main focus in life.
        I love mortuary medicine, or medicine in general, and want to investigate on it more. Im trying to make my own two main stories real into an FPS game & an illustrated book. I love the color green, Im deeply passionate about forests and greenland.
        I love music, recommendations of it very much welcome.
         <br> I am a huge fan of art avant-garde art movements & its members, my biggest fascination and inspiration being expressionism. 
          Im still studying about it, if you'd like to share a fact or two with me or speak with eachother about it, or avant-garde in general, dont fret to message me.</p>
